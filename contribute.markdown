As many other open-source projects Steam Condenser benefits from the
participation of its community. Any contribution will help to make Steam
Condenser better.

## How to contribute?

1. **Find bugs and report them**<br />
   Just use Steam Condenser and find bugs or other issues. Report them at the
   [issue tracker][1] and they *will* be fixed.
2. **Request new features**<br />
   Do you have a cool new idea that would fit well into Steam Condenser's
   functionality? Or do you have a nice little feature that would make Steam
   Condenser's features even better? Don't hesitate to propose them at the
   [issue tracker][1].
3. **Write patches**<br />
   Don't want to wait for bugs to be fixed and features to be added? Just start
   your own [fork][2] of Steam Condenser at [GitHub][3], make your own changes
   to the code and they will most likely find their way into the main
   library.
4. **Start an implementation for another language**<br />
   You think Steam Condenser is a great library? But you want to code in another
   language? Go on, start a Steam Condenser [fork][2] and develop your own Steam
   Condenser in any language you want, e.g. C++, Perl or Phyton.
